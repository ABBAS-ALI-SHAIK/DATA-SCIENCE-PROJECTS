Analyzing data from the Drug Discovery field using Python tools, such as Machine Learning.

Using the Pandas library, I analyzed the available data and completed the proposed challenges.

Using the Seaborn and Matplotlib libraries, I analyzed the available data and generated visualization graphs.

Using the Seaborn and Numpy libraries, I analyzed the available data through scatter and correlation graphs.

Using the merge function from Pandas, we linked two dataframes and created new columns for visualization, which was done through graphs and consolidated data.
